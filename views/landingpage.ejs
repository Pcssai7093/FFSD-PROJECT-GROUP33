            A freelancer is hired for a specific project, service, or task by the client (or conventionally the employer).A freelancer works on a variety of projects at the same time but for different clients. In a freelance job, one has to manage their priorities, time, and workload and do their taxes. That might feel like a lot to handle, but there is no feeling like being your boss. A freelancer can work from anywhere globally, and in given times, it mainly involves working from home.z
